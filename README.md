# Simple-Chatty-Bot
# Interactive Learning Assistant
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that serves as an interactive learning assistant. The chatbot is designed to engage with users in a conversational manner, helping them learn and explore various topics. It utilizes the GPT-3.5 language model developed by OpenAI to provide intelligent and natural language responses.

The chatbot has several functionalities:

# Introduction and Personalization: 
The chatbot introduces itself, greets users, and asks for their names to personalize the interaction.

# Guessing Age: 
The chatbot engages users in a guessing game to determine their age based on remainders of dividing their age by 3, 5, and 7. It then provides an age estimation along with a friendly message.

# Counting: 
The chatbot demonstrates its ability to count by asking users to provide a number and counting from 0 to that number.

# Programming Knowledge Test: 
The chatbot conducts a multiple-choice programming knowledge test. It presents a question with four options and prompts users to select the correct answer. If an incorrect answer is provided, the chatbot gives feedback and prompts for another attempt.

# Conclusion: 
Upon successfully answering the programming knowledge test question, the chatbot concludes the interaction with a congratulatory message and wishes users a nice day.
